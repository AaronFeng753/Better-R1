# Better-R1
An open webui function for better local R1 & QwQ experience

---

This is a simple open webui function for R1 & QwQ models, it can do the following:

1. Make sure every assistant message(model's response) always start with `<think>` tag.

2. Replace the simple `<think>` tags with `<details>` & `<summary>` tags, which makes R1's thoughts collapsible, like this:

<details>
<summary>Thought for 3 seconds ðŸ’­</summary>
Emmm.. LASAGNA...
</details>

3. Remove model's old thoughts in multi-turn conversation, according to deepseeks API docs you should always remove reasoning model's previous thoughts in a multi-turn conversation.
