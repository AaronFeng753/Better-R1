# Better-R1
A open webui function for better R1 experience

---

This is a simple open webui function for R1 models, it can do the following:

1. Replace the simple `<think>` tags with `<details>` & `<summary>` tags, which makes R1's thoughts collapsible, like this:

<details>
<summary>Thoughts💬</summary>
Emmm.. LASAGNA...
</details>

2. Remove R1's old thoughts in multi-turn conversation, according to deepseeks API docs you should always remove R1's previous thoughts in a multi-turn conversation.
